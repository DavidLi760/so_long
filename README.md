So_long is one of the first graphical project at 42 School.
I made a 3 player game for this project using the models of famous games like "Minecraft" and "Fish Eat Getting Big"

Player 1 : W S A D
Player 2 : ▲ ▼ ◀︎ ▶︎
Player 3 : Mouse Click

In my so_long the goal is to win by collecting all collectibles on the map without dying to the ghost fish.
But be careful the mouse fish can pass through walls contrary to players.
